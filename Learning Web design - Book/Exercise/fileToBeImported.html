    <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
    <p>
      Absolute units have predefined meanings or real-world equivalents. They
      are always the same size, regardless of the context in which they appear.
      The most popular absolute unit for web design is the pixel, which CSS3
      defines as 1/96 inch. Pixels are right at home on a pixel-based screen and
      offer precise control over the size of the text and elements on the page.
      For a while there, pixels were all we used. Then we realized they are too
      rigid for pages that need to adapt to a wide variety of screen sizes and
      user preferences. Relative measurements like rem, em, and % are more
      appropriate to the fluid nature of the medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      As long as we are kicking px to the curb, all of the absolute units—such
      as pt, pc, in, mm, and cm—are out because they are irrelevant on screens,
      although they may be useful for print style sheets. That narrows down your
      unit choices a bit. That said, pixels do still have their place in web
      design for elements that truly should stay the same size regardless of
      context. Border widths are appropriate in pixels, as are images that have
      inherent pixel dimensions.
    </p>

    <h2>Relative Units</h2>
    <p>
      As I just established, relative units are the way to go for most web
      measurements, and there are a few options: rem, em, and vw/vh. The rem
      unit CSS3 introduced a relative measurement called a rem (for root em)
      that is based on the font size of the root (html) element, whatever that
      happens to be. In modern browsers, the default root font size is 16
      pixels; therefore, a rem is equivalent to a 16-pixel unit (unless you set
      it explicitly to another value). An element sized to 10rem would measure
      160 pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, you can use rem units like an absolute measurement in
      style rules; however, because it is relative, if the base font size
      changes, so does the size of a rem. If a user changes the base font size
      to 24 pixels for easier reading from a distance, or if the page is
      displayed on a device that has a default font size of 24 pixels, that
      10rem element becomes 240 pixels. That seems dodgy, but rest assured that
      it is a feature, not a bug. There are many instances in which you want a
      layout element to expand should the text size increase. It keeps the page
      proportional with the font size, which can help maintain optimum line
      lengths.
