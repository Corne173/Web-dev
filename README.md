A collection of scripts exploring the basics of JS, HTML and CSS
Just testing a few scripts seeing how things are put together. The CSS is currently written into the HTML tags directly which will need to change going forward. 
The button set up at the top of the page should be a tab set like setup to navigate between pages very basic setup let me know if there is anything thats not clear and what direction 
you wish to take the project. Happy hacking !!!
